    "question": "Describe Singleton design pattern",
    "answer": "The Singleton design pattern is a creational design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to a single instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. It ensures that only one instance of the class exists throughout the application and provides a way to access that instance globally. The Singleton pattern is commonly used in scenarios where a single object needs to coordinate actions across the system.",
