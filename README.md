"KillTheInterview" is still in the early stages of development.

## Features Overview

"KillTheInterview" purpose is to help users prepare for a technical job interview. App main features are:

- Learning with curated questions & answers pool

Capabilities: 
- Fetching curated questions
- Generating questions using Open AI API
- Persisting bookmarked questions in local database

## Architecture

Project is built out of [KaMPKit][kampkit], which is a starter project for Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile apps.
The app is written in MVVM/MVI, aiming to follow [Modern App Architecture][modernAppArchitecture] guidelines throughout both, Android and KMM modules.

Objectives:
- Layered architecture with data, domain & UI layers
- Unidireactional Data Flow, Single Soure Of Truth
- Sharing as much code as possible in KMM module, so it can be reused throughout platforms
- Testability

Android module follows single-Activity architecture with Compose Navigation, where each screen has its own ViewModel from KMM module. iOS module development is not yet started.
