# ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§

"KillTheInterview" is still in the early stages of development.

## Features Overview

"KillTheInterview" purpose is to help users prepare for a technical job interview. App main features are:
- Interview simulation, using curated questions pool or AI powered
- Learning with curated questions & answers pool

Capabilities: 
- Fetching curated questions
- Generating questions using Open AI API
- Persisting bookmarked questions in local database

## Architecture

The app is written in MVVM/MVI, Single-Activity architecture with Compose Navigation, where each composable screen has its own ViewModel (that resides in shared KMM module and can be reused between Android and iOS), as well as:
- Layered architecture with data, domain & UI layers
- Unidireactional Data Flow, Single Soure Of Truth
- Testability

It generally follows [Modern App Architecture][modernAppArchitecture] guidelines.

The goal is to contain as much code in shared module as possible.
